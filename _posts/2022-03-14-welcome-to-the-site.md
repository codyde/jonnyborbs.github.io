Welcome to the new site! I've been experimenting with moving my blogs away from expensive, vulnerable, and time-consuming WordPress into something lighter weight, easier to maintain, free to host, etc. I know I'm a little behind the curve in adopting Jekyll, but it felt like the lightest-weight and easiest option for someone who basically thinks in markdown anyway.

So while I don't have a ton of high impact content to post right now, I might over time. This will be a spot for me to throw those Deep Thoughts.

Meanwhile, you can check out my [about me](/about/) page for more info about who I am and what I do, or my other two blogs linked in the sidebar if you want to learn about legacy VMware automation or DeLoreans.

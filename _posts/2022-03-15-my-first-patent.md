This is super exciting for me. I found out just a few days ago that a patent I filed for while at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) was granted. This is the first one I've had granted out of a half-dozen filings over the years, so it's really exciting to finally see my name out there!

Check out USPTO# US11223526B1 [Cloud computing infrastructure pipelines with run triggers](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11223526B1/) which outlines a novel mechanism for defining triggers between infrastructure nodes during their pipelined deployment. This was first applied in [Terraform Cloud](htttps://app.terraform.io) in early 2020.

When we shipped it, I wrote the launch blog [here](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/creating-infrastructure-pipelines-with-terraform-cloud-run-triggers) if you want a more user-friendly description of what it does.

And, while I'm pleased with myself for being listed as an inventor and I can genuinely claim a portion of the credit for the idea, it wouldn't have been possible without my team at the time. Casey and Krista are listed as co-inventors and indeed deserve the lion's share of the credit, but I can't forget the contributions of Nicola, Stacy, and the whole Terraform Cloud team that supported us.
